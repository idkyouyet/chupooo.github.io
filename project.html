                <h5><u>CHAPTER 1</u></h5>
                It was spring. Breeze was sweet and full of fragranced petals that wrapped around her. She was walking by the street to her favourite coffee place. Everything around her felt warm. She sat at her usual place and continued to write the story for her next book.<br>
                Suddenly the door opens. Air gushes in. The tiny bell hung above it rings. She hears him before she sees him. He was on a call and as soon as he entered the coffee place his call jst ended. He walks up to the barista.<br>
                Tony-"Hi Emma..."<br>
                Emma-"You are looking good Tony."<br>
                Tony-"Thanks......You are the best."<br>
                Emma-"There you go."<br>
                He gives a tender smile to her and takes his iced cappuccino and sits on the other side of the place facing towards me. In this short while I noticed him and it felt like time had stopped. I noticed his sweet gestures. He was wearing a black jacket and white tshirt inside it with blue jeans. He had big brown eyes and long dark lashes and black messed up hair - he had it all. He looked cute. His dressing sense was all describing his personality.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5><u>CHAPTER 2</u></h5>
                Today is a beautiful day. The sun is shining brightly, the grass is greener than ever, and the skies are pure blue. All around me is at peace. I have always wanted a day off. What could be much better than having a cappuccino in a vintage place ?<br>
                It feels good to be here. My eyes scanned the whole place and the place was quite empty. I see a women sitting right infront of me. My eyes got stuck on her. I started wondering...<br>
                Who is she ?<br>
                Have I ever seen her ?<br>
                I noticed her for a long time. She was fair and had dark brown hair that covered her bare shoulder and her face and I could still see the sunlight reaching her cheeks as if it wanted to desperately kiss her. She was wearing a white sleeveless dress with heels that exactly matched to her skin colour. She had huge eyes. Brown ones that sparkled amber. Oh god!! I couldn't stop staring at her eyes. All this while i noticed her. I fell in love with her the moment I saw her but who does that ?<br>
                I sat there for hours and couldn't stop thinking about her. I watched her continuously typing something in her laptop and sipping coffee and putting her hair behind her ears. Her small actions made me fall deeper.<br>
                Should i go to her ?<br>
                Random thoughts in my mind. Nope she is just a girl in a coffee shop...<br>
                But i couldn't stop myself so i go to her.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5><u>CHAPTER 3</u></h5>
                Is he walking over here ?<br>
                Is he walking towards me ?<br>
                I am a bit nervous. There are many thoughts going in my head right now. What if he is just going to the barista ?<br>
                Stop Pepper. Stop thinking too much.<br>
                Yeah he is coming here.<br>
                I look at him while he is standing infront of me across my table. I see him smiling again but this time he was smiling at me. I noticed his dimples that appeared while he smiled and his eyes were wrinkled at the corners. His smile was welcoming. I could see how it came from deep inside to light his eyes and spread into every part of him.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5><u>CHAPTER 4</u></h5>
                She seemed calm and little confused. I was staring at her. I saw her eyes closely. They are much prettier than before.<br>
                Tony-"Are you new to this place ?"<br>
                Pepper-"Yeah...moved here few weeks ago."<br>
                Tony-"Btw I am Tony Stark"<br>
                Pepper-"Hi, I am Pepper. Pepper Potts."<br>
                She says this while taking her hair behind her ear. She seemed little nervous.<br>
                Tony-"So what have you been doing here ?"<br>
                Pepper-"I am a novelist. I am just trying to figure out what my next story would be like."<br>
                Tony-"That's amazing. Novel writers are really interesting people."<br>
                Pepper-"Oh so do you know any other novelist"<br>
                Tony-"Nope I am jst assuming"<br>
                She laughs. I am trying hard not to blush.<br>
                Tony-"So if you have spare time would you mind for some coffee ?"<br>
                Pepper-"Yeah please get me some coffee. I don't have friends here. It would be lovely to have a cup of coffee with you."<br>
                Tony-"Cool"<br>
                I call Emma and ask her fr two cups of coffee.<br>
                Pepper-"So for how long have you been living here ?"<br>
                Tony-"I have been here since 4 years."<br>
                Pepper-"Then you must be familiar to each and everyone over here."<br>
                Tony-"Yeah I know many people but haven't met anyone as beautiful as you are"<br>
                Why did i even say that ?<br>
                Now she must thinking of me to be some creep. Why do I put salt on my own wounds ? Why can't i keep my mouth shut ? <br>
                She starts laughing.<br>
                Pepper-"You must be really funny"<br>
                Her laugh is so beautiful. I was staring at here while she was laughing. I was pretty much lost.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5><u>CHAPTER 5</u></h5>
                Whatttt....did he flirt ?<br> He did.<br>
                I could feel my cheeks getting red.<br>
                Emma brings us our coffee. We started talking and minutes turned to hours and we did'nt even realise and it was evening already. We spoke to each other about our favourite music band, movies and hobbies, what we do, places we have visited so far, about our friends, favourite memories. Yesss he flirted a lot and i liked it. It felt as if i have known him for years. Is this feeling stupid ?<br>
                Does it happen to anyone that you meet a random guy and talk to him for a day and feel as if you have already known him ?<br>
                I loved that day. It was magical. And it kinda made me sad cause it was getting dark already.<br>
                Tony-"Do you want to go for a dinner with me ?"<br>
                Pepper-"Right now ?"<br>
                Tony-"Yeah its getting late already and we have been sitting here for long. Also we could consider that as a date.."<br>
                Did he ask me out ??????? <br>
                Pepper-"Take me to your favourite place. But promise me that we would watch stars after the dinner ?"<br>
                Uhuhuhhh.....yeah i can flirt too.
                He gives a wide smile.<br>
                Tony-"I would love to."<br>
                I became the happiest person ever...<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h5><u>CHAPTER 6</u></h5>
                I take her to my car. I open the door for her. I talk even while driving. I wasn't able to stop talking to her and nor was she. We both seemed really invested into each other. I take her to a fancy restaurant 'Chez Panisse'. We order some pasta and red wine. Everything seemed so perfect just like a dream. Is she for real ?<br>
                She is the prettiest women I have come so far. No doubt she is beautiful but other than her physic she has a beautiful heart. Anyone would fall in love with her. I am glad I met her. Dinner was really good. Maybe it was just her presence that made it good. Do i love her ?<br>
                It took me just one unplanned date to fall in love with her. I am still not sure about this. But i like were this thing was heading out.<br>
                She took me to her favourite place. It was a park. She lies down and seeing her so do I.<br>
                Pepper-"I love to come here during the night. This place becomes quite. I come here, lay on the grass, play my favourite music and just watch the stars. Their sparkle fascinates me. They make me wonder about the meaning and purpose of human existence, wonder about our tiny size in the infinite universe"<br>
                I kept listening to her speak and I understood what she exactly meant. I loved to listen to her voice as if her voice was some beautiful music. I watched her sparkling eyes under the dark sky and it reminded me that yes maybe this is it. That moment I knew that I was in love with her and she was still some girl I met in the coffee shop.<br>
