Babyyyy
I love you more than this. I love all of you. All of ur insecurities. I would kiss you even if you are bassi. I would do anything jst to see you happy. We are cuteee together.  We'll always be. I love you aduuu no matter what. You will always be my everything and i can never get bored of you. Doing things fr you jst makes me happy and you haven't seen anything of me yet. I can be veryyy romantic. I am someone who would love to plan things for you. I hope that someday i get to do all the things fr you soon. These 153 reasons are actually nothing. My feelings for you is sooo much more than these words. I hope someday i jst get to show how much u mean to me. U r my world. I would love to be wid you everywhere. Travel wid you, go out for shopping, get a puppy, cook with you, date nights where i can get all dressed up, club nights, hang out wid friends, showing you off, keep kissing you and doing lot many things to you. You might be bored of reading this. I didn't realise that i wrote so much but again thik hai na.<br><br>
Also i remember the two rules of our relationship.<br>
1.Always be honest to each other.<br>
2.If any one of us is sad or feel like crying always call each other.<br><br>

I LOVE YOU..
